# White Label

IronWiFi allows you to white label your landing page URL and emails and get rid of the IronWifi sender, subject, and design on your emails. You can start to build your domainâ€™s email reputation and explicitly show all your recipients that you sent these emails. This should help increase your deliverability rates and reduce your potential for spam reports.

White labeling is critical to your reputation as a sender. Inbox providers distrust messages that are not properly white-labeled, and you will not be able to start building your reputation until you complete the white labeling process.

There are a few quick points worth highlighting before you dive into the white labeling process.

- You can only have one white label per account.
- The email white labeling process requires you to create a SendGrid account and send an email through this account.
- You will have to generate SendGrid API Keys and Transactional templates
- Team members can access the parent white labels or white labels created by other team members if their Role permits.
- We provide all the information about every step of the process below so that you can set up your white label quickly and easily.
