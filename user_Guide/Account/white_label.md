# White Label

IronWiFi allows you to white label your landing page URL and emails and get rid of the IronWifi sender, subject, and design on your emails. You can start to build your domainâ€™s email reputation and explicitly show all your recipients that you sent these emails. This should help increase your deliverability rates and reduce your potential for spam reports.

White labeling is critical to your reputation as a sender. Inbox providers distrust messages that are not properly white-labeled, and you will not be able to start building your reputation until you complete the white labeling process.

There are a few quick points worth highlighting before you dive into the white labeling process.

- You can only have one white label per account.
- The email white labeling process requires you to create a SendGrid account and send an email through this account.
- You will have to generate SendGrid API Keys and Transactional templates
- Team members can access the parent white labels or white labels created by other team members if their Role permits.
- We provide all the information about every step of the process below so that you can set up your white label quickly and easily.

## Email White Label Settings

**API token** - The API token used to send email through SendGrid platform.

**Sender Email** - Valid email address that will be included in sent emails. Recipients will reply to this email address.

## Hostname White Label Settings

Partners, Resellers, and Enterprise customers can improve their brand by using their domain name for landing pages.

To set up an alias, do the following:

1. Identify the type of hostname that your WiFi vendor requires. You can see the required format in the Captive Portal settings after you select your WiFi Vendor. Depending on the required format, make the following changes to your DNS server settings:

        1. **_splash.YOUR_DOMAIN_**
           - add a CNAME record and redirect host splash.YOUR_DOMAIN to ghs.googlehosted.com
           - ask the IronWifi support team to add your domain alias to Google Apps Engine settings.
           - Cooperate with the support team during the domain validation process
           
        2. **_splash-static.YOUR_DOMAIN_**
           - Add an A record and connect splash-static.YOUR_DOMAIN to 35.184.225.240 (US region), or 35.195.230.167 (EU region), or 35.201.240.80 (Asia Pacific region)
           - generate an SSL certificate for this sub-domain and send both private key and public certificate to the IronWifi support team.
           
        3. **_splashUNIQUE_ID.YOUR_DOMAIN_**
           - Add a CNAME record and redirect splashUNIQUE_ID.YOUR_DOMAIN to ghs.googlehosted.com. UNIQUE_ID is displayed in the Captive Portal settings in IronWifi Console
           - ask the IronWifi support team to add your domain alias to Google Apps Engine settings.
