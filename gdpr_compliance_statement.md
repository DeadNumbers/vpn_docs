# GDPR Compliance Statement

The **_EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)_** came into force across the European Union on 25th May 2018 and brought with it the most significant changes to data protection law in two decades. Based on privacy by design and taking a “risk-based” approach, the GDPR has been designed to meet the requirements of the digital age.

The new regulation aims to give individuals stronger, more consistent rights to access and control their personal information.

**Our Commitment**

**IronWifi LLC** is committed to ensuring the security and protection of the personal information that we process, and to provide a compliant and consistent approach to data protection. We have particular regard to ethical as well as compliant use of personal data, with a commitment to ensure that no individual suffers harm.

**IronWifi LLC** is committed to safeguarding the personal information under our control and in continually developing a data protection regime that is effective.

**Our Practices**

We already have a consistent level of data protection and security across our organization. The following summarizes critical areas.

- **_Policies & Procedures_** – our data protection practices and procedures meet the requirements and standards of the GDPR, including: -
  - **_Data Protection_** –Accountability and governance are in place to ensure that we understand, adequately disseminate, and evidence our obligations and responsibilities; with a focus on privacy by design and the rights of individuals.
  - **_Data Retention & Erasure_** – we meet the ‘data minimization’ and ‘storage limitation principle. All personal information is stored, archived, and destroyed compliantly and ethically.
  - **_Data Breaches_** – we can identify, assess, investigate, and report any personal data breach at the earliest possible time.
  - **_Subject Access Request (SAR)_** – our SAR practices accommodate the 30-day time frame for providing the requested information and for making this provision free of charge.
- **_Privacy Notice/Policy_** – we fully comply with the GDPR, ensuring that all individuals whose personal data we process have been informed of why we need it, how we use it, what their rights are, to whom we disclose the information and what safeguarding measures are in place to protect their data.
- **_Obtaining Consent_** - we have updated our consent mechanisms for obtaining personal data, ensuring that individuals understand what they are providing, why and how we use it and giving clear, defined ways to consent to us processing their information. We have developed stringent processes for recording consent, making sure that we can evidence an affirmative opt-in, along with time and date records; and an easy way to withdraw consent at any time.
- **_Direct Marketing_** - we do not directly market our services via information held on individuals in our company.

Specific category data is only processed where necessary and is only processed where we have first identified the appropriate Article 9(2) basis or the Data Protection Bill Schedule 1 condition. Where we rely on consent for processing, this is explicit and is verified by a signature, with the right to modify or remove consent being signposted.
